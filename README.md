# Dami-s_Book_Recommender
Hi all! This is my first official data science project
It is a book recommender system
It recommends books similar of the book you choose
I built it using a Random Forest Classifier algorithim
I sourced the data set from Kaggle which I cleaned and manipulated
The original datasets are .csv files and this was scripted and Jupyter Notebook
Thank you!
